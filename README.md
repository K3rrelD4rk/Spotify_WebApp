This is a web-app I've done as a school project.
I was issued to use spotify APIs to get users playlist, search for songs, ecc..

In this web-app the player is functioning even though I don't have premium,
for this I used Youtube-APIs, basically I changed the preview_url inside spotify
packages with the audio url I get after search the name of the song + the artist on youtube

There are some bugs but maybe in the future I'll try to fix them
